                Ways to Help Our Community
            </h1>
        <h2>SHARE YOUR STORY.</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best ways to help is by telling your story. Be vulnerable. 
            Be transparent. Let down the barriers that inhibit your truth. We at 
            REACH believe that story-telling is one of the greatest ways to connect our community. 
            By sharing your unique life story, we hope you find support and acceptance while letting others 
            in our community know that they are not alone.
        </p>
        <h2>SUPPORT OTHERS.</h2>
        <p>
            Without the support of others, we are nothing. REACH exists to support our users by providing 
            resources and connections. We hope that you help our community by supporting other users through 
            listening, respecting, and trusting one another. 
        </p>
        <h2>DONATE.</h2>
        <p>
            As a nonprofit organization, REACH relies on the generous donations of our 
            community to provide resources and assistance to our users.
